# GULF (Generative UI Language Format) Protocol

This repository contains the specification for the GULF (Generative UI Language Format) protocol, a JSONL-based, streaming UI protocol designed to be easily generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Overview

The GULF protocol enables a server to stream a platform-agnostic, abstract UI definition to a client, which then renders it progressively using a native widget set. The core design principles are:

*   **LLM-Friendly**: The protocol uses a simple, declarative, and flat structure that is easy for LLMs to generate.
*   **Progressive Rendering**: The UI is streamed as a series of JSONL messages, allowing the client to render the UI as it arrives, improving perceived performance.
*   **Platform-Agnostic**: The protocol defines an abstract component tree, and the client is responsible for mapping these abstract components to its native widget implementations.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: The protocol separates the UI structure (components), the application state (data model), and the client-side widget rendering.

## Repository Layout

The repository is structured as follows:

*   `specification/`: This directory contains the formal specification for the GULF protocol. The main specification document provides a detailed explanation of the protocol's design, architecture, and data flow.
*   `specification/json/`: This directory contains the JSON schema files used to validate GULF protocol messages and client event messages.
